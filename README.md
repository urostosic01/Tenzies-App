# Tenzies-App
Tenzie web app from Learn React course(Coursera)

## About The Project

Created project using Vite. Used additional packages 'nanoid' to generate unique string ID for each die and 'react-confetti' as a decoration for completed game.
Each die gets random value from 1 to 6 and has boolean property which signalizes when die is held in hand. 
At the end we check if we have 10 dice in our hand with same value and if so, we celebrate victory with confetti.
